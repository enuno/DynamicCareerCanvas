feat(foundation): complete rebuild planning and AI documentation

Created comprehensive development plan and AI-specific documentation:
- DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md with 7-phase implementation strategy
- .ai/CONTEXT.md with project context for AI assistants
- .ai/CONVENTIONS.md with detailed coding standards
- .ai/PROMPTS.md with reusable prompt library
- New directory structure following best practices

This establishes foundation for AI-human collaborative development
with clear patterns, conventions, and documentation.

## Guidelines for Updating This Changelog

### When to Add an Entry

Add an entry when:
- Significant features are implemented with AI assistance
- Major refactoring is done with AI help
- Documentation is created or substantially updated by AI
- AI helps solve complex bugs or performance issues
- Design changes are implemented with AI collaboration

### What to Include

Each entry should contain:
1. **Date** of the work session
2. **AI Tool** name and version used
3. **Operator** (human directing the AI)
4. **Duration** (approximate)
5. **Changes Made** - categorized list of what was done
6. **Attribution** - the exact commit message(s) used
7. **Files/Directories** created or modified
8. **Context** - why these changes were made

### What NOT to Include

Don't log:
- Minor typo fixes
- Simple one-line changes
- Routine content updates
- Changes made entirely by humans without AI assistance

### Attribution Best Practices

Always include in git commits:
```
AI-Assisted: [Tool Name]
Tool: [CLI/IDE/etc]
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Monthly Review

At the end of each month:
1. Review all AI contributions
2. Calculate percentage of AI vs human contributions
3. Assess quality and effectiveness
4. Adjust AI collaboration approach if needed
5. Update prompts library based on learnings

### Transparency Principles

This changelog maintains transparency by:
- Clearly marking AI-assisted work
- Providing context for AI involvement
- Documenting both successes and challenges
- Enabling review of AI contribution quality
- Supporting informed decisions about AI tool usage
