about_content: |
    I’m a Senior Systems and Networking Engineer with 20 years of hands-on experience in building and optimizing ISP and telecom infrastructure.

    My passion lies in solving complex challenges in DevOps, cloud, and distributed systems engineering, always with a focus on innovation and reliability.

    I thrive in leading large-scale projects, guiding teams, and fostering a collaborative environment where cutting-edge solutions are brought to life.

    As a Blockchain, Web3, and DePIN evangelist, I’m dedicated to advancing these technologies to create a more connected, secure, and decentralized world.

    Whether it’s architecting resilient networks or mentoring the next generation of engineers, I approach every task with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.
